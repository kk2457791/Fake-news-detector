A machine learning tool to detect fake news
# Fake News Detector - Hackathon Project Setup

This guide will help you set up and run the Fake News Detector project for your hackathon. The project consists of a React frontend and a Flask backend with machine learning capabilities.

```

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- Python (v3.8 or higher)
- pip (Python package manager)
- npm (Node.js package manager)

## Step 1: Setting Up the Backend

1. Create a virtual environment and activate it:

```bash
# Navigate to the backend directory
cd backend

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate virtual environment
# On Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate
```

2. Install the required Python packages:

```bash
pip install flask flask-cors scikit-learn pandas numpy nltk beautifulsoup4 requests joblib
```

3. Create a `requirements.txt` file for reproducibility:

```bash
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

## Step 2: Setting Up the Frontend

1. Create a new React app:

```bash
npx create-react-app frontend
cd frontend
```

2. Install required npm packages:

```bash
npm install tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
```

3. Set up Tailwind CSS:

```bash
npx tailwindcss init -p
```

4. Update `tailwind.config.js`:

```javascript
/** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */
module.exports = {
  content: [
    "./src/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}",
  ],
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [],
}
```

## Step 3: Copy the Code Files

1. Copy the provided React components into the appropriate directories in the frontend
2. Copy the Flask backend code into `app.py`
3. Copy the model training script into `model_training.py`

## Step 4: Running the Application

### Start the Backend:

```bash
# Make sure you're in the backend directory with the virtual environment activated
python app.py
```

The Flask server will start on http://localhost:5000

### Start the Frontend:

```bash
# In a new terminal, navigate to the frontend directory
cd frontend
npm start
```

The React app will start on http://localhost:3000

## Step 5: Training the ML Model (Optional)

For demonstration purposes, the application can run with a mock model. To train a real model:

1. Download a fake news dataset (See recommendations in the model_training.py file)
2. Place the dataset in the `data/` directory
3. Run the training script:

```bash
# In the backend directory with the virtual environment activated
python model_training.py
```

## Extending the Project (Hackathon Ideas)

If you have time during the hackathon, consider these enhancements:

1. **Improve the ML Model:**
   - Use more advanced NLP techniques like BERT or other transformer models
   - Implement ensemble methods by combining multiple classifiers
   - Add feature engineering to extract more meaningful patterns from text

2. **Enhance the Web Interface:**
   - Add a history feature to save previous analysis results
   - Implement dark mode
   - Add visualizations showing what parts of the text triggered the classification
   - Create a dashboard showing statistics of analyzed content

3. **Build the Browser Extension:**
   - Create a simple Chrome extension that can analyze content on the current page
   - Add highlighting of potentially misleading content directly on web pages
   - Implement a popup with the analysis results when hovering over a paragraph

4. **Improve Content Analysis:**
   - Add source credibility checking by comparing against a database of known sources
   - Implement cross-reference checking with other news articles
   - Add sentiment analysis to detect emotional manipulation in text
   - Implement image analysis for detecting manipulated images

5. **User Feedback System:**
   - Add a way for users to provide feedback on analysis results
   - Use this feedback to improve the model over time
   - Implement a simple dashboard to show community feedback stats

## Presentation Tips for the Hackathon

1. **Demo Preparation:**
   - Prepare a few example articles (both real and fake) to demonstrate during your presentation
   - Make sure your demo can work offline in case of connectivity issues
   - Have screenshots ready as a backup

2. **Key Points to Cover:**
   - The social problem your project addresses
   - Your technical approach and architecture
   - ML model features and accuracy
   - Live demo of the application
   - Future enhancements you would make with more time

3. **Technical Challenges:**
   - Be prepared to discuss the challenges you faced and how you overcame them
   - Highlight any clever solutions or optimizations you implemented

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **CORS Errors:**
   - If you see CORS errors in the browser console, make sure the Flask backend has CORS properly enabled
   - Check that the frontend is making requests to the correct backend URL

2. **Model Loading Errors:**
   - If the model fails to load, check that the model directory exists and the training script completed successfully
   - For hackathon purposes, the app will fall back to mock predictions if no model is found

3. **Slow Text Processing:**
   - For large articles, consider implementing a loading indicator
   - You can also implement text summarization to process only the most relevant parts
